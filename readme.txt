1. Introduction
This is a silly & cruel world built by silly python code.
A group of primitive 'bugs' are fed in this world, I would like to call them 'people'.
As the god of the world, I prepare food 'responsibly', develop rules, watch them evolve.

2. Goals:
2.1. Get a tough species
As plenty variable genes have been planted into init bugs, which result in huge amount of possibility,
I want to see if there are some specific kinds domain the 'word'.
Obviously, this is kind of evolution!!!
It doesn't matter whether someone have been working on similar things, the satisfaction of hand craft is enough.

2.2 Get a game with talk able NPC
All the 'bugs' have only two things to do everyday: Filling the stomach and interaction.
As interaction part is an intelligent process, talk or fight with the NPCs will be interesting game experience
after surviving from cruel competition of food collection.

2.3 Get high level intelligent behavior
After discussing with friends in the philosophy department, I realized the seeds of social behavior.
So I will add this feature in, trying to get some social like activities.

Future work:
1.Visualize the processing
2.Replace Destination-Selection module,Action-Reaction module with Neural-Net-Work
